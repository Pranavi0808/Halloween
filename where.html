        ## Where is Halloween Celebrated?

        While Halloween originated from Celtic and Christian traditions, it is now celebrated in many countries around the world. The extent and style of celebrations can vary significantly:
        
        - **United States and Canada:** Halloween is widely celebrated with trick-or-treating, costume parties, and elaborate decorations.
        - **United Kingdom and Ireland:** Celebrations are similar to North America, with a stronger emphasis on traditional games and fortune-telling.
        - **Mexico and Latin America:** DÃ­a de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) coincides with Halloween, featuring unique traditions to honor deceased loved ones.
        - **Australia and New Zealand:** Halloween is gaining popularity, especially among younger generations, with increasing participation in costume parties and trick-or-treating.
        - **Japan:** While not a traditional holiday, Halloween has become popular in recent years, particularly in urban areas, with costume parties and themed events.
        - **Germany:** Halloween celebrations are growing, especially in larger cities, often blending with traditional harvest festivals.
        
        It's important to note that the way Halloween is celebrated can differ greatly even within countries, often depending on local customs, religious beliefs, and cultural norms.
