        The Haunting History of Halloween

        Halloween, celebrated on October 31st, has roots that stretch back over 2,000 years to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. This festival marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, a time when the boundary between the world of the living and the dead was believed to blur.
        
        Key milestones in Halloween's evolution:
        
        - Ancient Origins (Celtic Samhain): Celts believed that on the night of October 31, ghosts of the dead could return to the world of the living.
        - Roman Influence: As the Roman Empire conquered Celtic lands, their festivals of Feralia and Pomona merged with Samhain.
        - Christian Adaptation: The Christian church established All Saints' Day on November 1, with the evening before known as All Hallows' Eve, eventually becoming Halloween.
        - American Transformation: Irish immigrants brought Halloween traditions to America in the 19th century, where it evolved into the holiday we know today.
